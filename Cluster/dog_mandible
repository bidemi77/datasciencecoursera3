/* 
(1) W e didi not standardize the attributes (or viable measurements). When the attributes are not standaradized, then the 
clustering algorithm will focus on the variables of largest magnitude .

(2) We did not reduce the dimension of our problem. Cluster analysis works best in lower dimensions. Points get far apart quickly as the dimension of the attribute space grows.
